Materialized mxw-git
Analyzing mxw-git AUR package with deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash
Performing initial audit of PKGBUILD to ensure that we can safely run `makepkg`
LLM auditresponse for PKGBUILD:
<security_assessment>
<decision>SAFE</decision>
<details>
The PKGBUILD's global scope contains only variable assignments, comments, and function definitions. There are no command substitutions or top-level code execution that could be dangerous. The `pkgver()`, `build()`, and `package()` functions are defined but not invoked, so they are not executed during `makepkg --printsrcinfo`. No suspicious network requests, file operations, or obfuscated code exist at the top level.

LLM auditresponse for .SRCINFO:
<security_assessment>
<decision>SAFE</decision>
<details>
This is a standard AUR `.SRCINFO` metadata file for a VCS package. It defines the package source as a git repository from the project's own upstream URL, uses `SKIP` for checksums (required for `git` sources), and declares standard build dependencies. No executable code, obfuscated content, suspicious network requests, or system modifications are present. The file conforms to normal packaging practices.

LLM auditresponse for .gitignore:
<security_assessment>
<decision>SAFE</decision>
<details>
This is a standard `.gitignore` file containing a single asterisk, which instructs Git to ignore all files in the repository. This is a common practice for packaging repositories (like AUR) that only need to track specific metadata files (e.g., PKGBUILD, .SRCINFO) and exclude build artifacts or generated files. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, network requests, or system modifications.</details>

LLM auditresponse for PKGBUILD:
<security_assessment>
<decision>SAFE</decision>
<details>
This PKGBUILD follows standard AUR packaging practices for a VCS-based Rust application. The source is fetched from the project's own upstream GitHub repository, which is expected. The build uses `cargo build --release` and the package function installs the resulting binary. There are no suspicious network requests, obfuscated code, eval statements, or any commands that deviate from normal packaging workflow. The `md5sums` are set to `SKIP`, which is standard and required for VCS sources. No evidence of supply-chain attack or malicious behavior is present.
