XML seems to be processed better by LLMs.
* TODO Make the session class a little smarter
It should actually encapsulate the LLM calls. The OpenAI client will live
inside the session class. That way it can track sizes internally without
callers having to track sizes.
* TODO Improve debug logging
Just use python logging framework and send it to the tmp debug log file.

Currently we only flush the logs at the end, but sometimes things get
hung before that. We should configure `logging` to get logs right
away.
