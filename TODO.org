* TODO Send recursive file listing to agent and remove listdir tool
Agent can decide which files (possibly all) to read

In order to maintain its own state, I think the agent is going to need a
"WriteFile" tool to keep a checklist of files it needs to review. Or do you
think it will be able to keep it in its context? I worry that it will
forget since it could be reading some huge files, so the history of files
it has already read is going to fall out of context. It's almost like
during the code review portion it would be a "recursive" agentic LLM call,
don't need the full audit conversation history to perform a code review of
a single file. And the audit conversation history only needs to record the
outcome of the review in its context, not the code listing or the code
review / audit report. What's the canonical/proper way to handle this in an
agentic LLM loop?
* TODO API cost
Is this info available in the API response or through some OpenRouter API?
