* TODO API cost and token usage improvements
Create a wrapper class for our "client" instance (OpenAI). This will contain an
OpenAI instance, and also take care of aggregating all costs and token usage
throughout the whole session.

For OpenRouter we can use their API to dynamically retrieve up-to-date pricing info:

> curl -s https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models | jq '.data[] | select(.id == "qwen/qwen3-coder") | .pricing'
{
  "prompt": "0.0000002",
  "completion": "0.0000008",
  "request": "0",
  "image": "0",
  "audio": "0",
  "web_search": "0",
  "internal_reasoning": "0"
}
* TODO Make file selection (much) smarter.
When auditing `yay`, for example, it pulls in random dependencies. Unless we're auditing absolutely everything we should make the filtering more intelligent. might need the agent to do a source dive, give it some tools (listdir, readfile)
